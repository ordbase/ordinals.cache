### Null / Nil - The Billion Dollar Mistake ++ Zero - The Billion Dollar Fix

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965.

> My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe,
> with checking performed automatically by the compiler.
> But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference,
> simply because it was so easy to implement.
> This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes,
> which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.

Let's make the code safer and
let's say goodbye to null / nil (and maybe).
How can the code work without nil?


Let's say hello to zero.
The new rule for NO null/nil ever (again) is:

**All variables - including structs, arrays and hash mappings -
MUST ALWAYS get set (initialized) to ZERO (default) values.**

What's zero?

| Type           | Value                      |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Integer        | `0`      or `Integer.zero` |
| Bool           | `false`  or `Bool.zero`    |
| String         | `''` or `String.zero`      |
| Array          | `[]` or `Array.zero`       |
| Hash           | `{}` or `Hash.zero`        |
| Vote (Struct)  | `Vote.new( 0, false, 0, '0x0000')` or `Vote.zero`  |
| Address        | `0x0000` or `Address.zero` or `Address(0)`         |
| ...            |                                                    |


### Safe Struct

Lets you define (auto-build) new struct classes.
Example:

``` ruby
SafeStruct.new( :Voter, weight: 0, voted: false, vote: 0, delegate: '0x0000' )

voter1 = Voter.new    # or Voter.new_zero
voter1.weight      #=> 0
voter1.voted?      #=> false
voter1.vote        #=> 0
voter1.delegate    #=> '0x0000'
voter1.frozen?     #=> false

voter1 == Voter.zero    #=> true
voter1 == Voter(0)      #=> true

voter1.delegate = '0x1111'
voter1 == Voter.zero    #=> false

voter2 = Voter.new( 0, false, 0, '0x0000')  

voter2.voted    = true
voter2.delegate = '0x2222'
voter2 == Voter.zero     #=> false

Voter.zero.frozen?       #=> true

voter3 = Voter.new( 0 )  #=> ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments
                         #     for Voter.new - 1 for 4
```


Note: You can use `Struct` as an alias for `SafeStruct`
(in the `Safe` namespace) or use the `struct`
class method macro:

``` ruby
struct( :Voter, weight: 0, voted: false, vote: 0, delegate: '0x0000')
# or
struct :Voter, { weight: 0, voted: false, vote: 0, delegate: '0x0000' }
# or
struct :Voter, weight: 0, voted: false, vote: 0, delegate: '0x0000'
# or
struct :Voter,
  weight:    0,
  voted:     false,
  vote:      0,
  delegate: '0x0000'
```


### Safe Array

Lets you define (auto-build) new (type safe) array classes.
Example:

``` ruby
Array‹Integer› = SafeArray.build_class( Integer )
ary = Array‹Integer›.new   ## note: same as Integer[].new
ary.size       #=> 0
ary[0]         #=> IndexError: index 0 outside of array bounds
ary.size = 2   #=> [0,0]
ary[0]         #=> 0
```

or use the `Array.of` convenience shortcut:

``` ruby
ary = Array.of( Integer ).new    ## note: same as Array‹Integer›.new or Integer[].new
ary.size       #=> 0
ary[0]         #=> IndexError: index 0 outside of array bounds
ary.size = 2   #=> [0, 0]
ary[0]         #=> 0

## or

another_ary = Array.of( Bool ).new    ## note: same as Array‹Bool›.new or Bool[].new
another_ary.size      #=> 0
another_ary[0]        #=> IndexError: index 0 outside of array bounds
another_ary.size = 2  #=> [false, false]
another_ary[0]        #=> false

## or

another_ary = Array.of( Bool, 2 ).new    ## note: same as Array‹Bool›×2.new or Bool[2].new
another_ary.size      #=> 2
another_ary[0]        #=> false
```

Yes, Safe Array works with structs (or nested arrays or hash mappings) too. Example:

``` ruby
ary = Array.of( Vote ).new    # same as Array‹Vote›.new or Vote[].new

ary[0]         #=> IndexError: index 0 outside of array bounds
ary.size = 2   #=> [#<Vote @weight=0, @voted=false, @vote=0, @delegate='0x0000'>,
               #    #<Vote @weight=0, @voted=false, @vote=0, @delegate='0x0000'>]
ary[0]         #=> #<Vote @weight=0, @voted=false, @vote=0, @delegate='0x0000'>
ary[0].voted?  #=> false
```


### Safe Hash

Lets you define (auto-build) new (type safe) hash classes.
Example:

``` ruby
Hash‹String→Integer› = SafeHash.build_class( String, Integer )
hash = Hash‹String→Integer›.new

hash['0x0000']  #=> 0
```

or use the `Hash.of` convenience shortcut:

``` ruby
hash = Hash.of( String => Integer ).new   ## note: same as Hash‹String→Integer›.new

hash['0x0000']         #=> 0
hash['0x0000'] += 42
hash['0x0000']         #=> 42
```

Note: Safe Hash will ALWAYS return a value.
If the key is missing in the hash mapping on lookup,
the key gets auto-added with a zero value.
Use `has_key?` or `key?` to check if a key is present (or missing).


Yes, Safe Hash works with structs (or arrays or nested hash mappings) too. Example:

``` ruby
hash = Hash.of( String => Vote ).new    ## note: same as Hash‹String→Vote›.new

hash['0x0000']                #=> #<Vote @weight=0, @voted=false, @vote=0, @delegate='0x0000'>
hash['0x0000'].voted?         #=> false
hash['0x0000'].voted = true
hash['0x0000'].voted?         #=> true

# or

allowances = Hash.of( String => Hash.of( String => Integer ) ).new  ## note: same as Hash‹String→Hash‹String→Integer››.new 

allowances['0x1111']['0xaaaa'] = 100
allowances['0x1111']['0xbbbb'] = 200
allowances['0x2222']['0xaaaa'] = 300

allowances['0x1111']['0xaaaa']  #=> 100
allowances['0x1111']['0xbbbb']  #=> 200
allowances['0x2222']['0xaaaa']  #=> 300

allowances['0x2222'].delete( '0xaaaa' )
allowances['0x2222']['0xaaaa']  #=> 0
```

### Bonus: Auto-Generated Unicode (UTF-8) Class Constants / Names for Pretty Printing

Did you know? Yes, you can use unicode characters in your identifiers.
The safe data structures library auto-generates unicode class constants / names
for pretty printing and more. Examples:

| Class Builder                          | Class Constant / Name |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `Array.of( Integer )`                  | `Array‹Integer›` |
| `Array.of( Bool )`                     | `Array‹Bool›`    |
| `Array.of( Bool, 2 )`                  | `Array‹Bool›×2`  |
| `Array.of( Vote )`                     | `Array‹Vote›`    |
| `Array.of( Array.of( Integer, 3), 3 )` | `Array‹Array‹Integer›×3›×3`  |
| `Hash.of( String => Integer )`         | `Hash‹String→Integer›`       |
| `Hash.of( String => Vote )`            | `Hash‹String→Vote›`          |
| `Hash.of( String => Hash.of( String => Integer ))` | `Hash‹String→Hash‹String→Integer››` |
| ...                                                |                                     |


Note, and yes if the typing is not too much - you can use
the "magic" names in your code too. Example:

``` ruby
ary = Array‹Integer›.new
ary.size       #=> 0
ary[0]         #=> IndexError: index 0 outside of array bounds
ary.size = 2   #=> [0,0]
ary[0]         #=> 0

# or

another_ary = Array‹Bool›×2.new
another_ary.size      #=> 2
another_ary[0]        #=> false

# or

hash = Hash‹String→Integer›.new
hash['0x0000']         #=> 0
hash['0x0000'] += 42
hash['0x0000']         #=> 42

# or

allowances = Hash‹String→Hash‹String→Integer››.new
allowances['0x1111']['0xaaaa'] = 100
allowances['0x1111']['0xbbbb'] = 200
allowances['0x2222']['0xaaaa'] = 300
```

and so on.


### What about Safe Enumeration (Integer) Types?

Yes, yes, yes. The `Enum` class from the enums library gets auto-required.
Use like:

``` ruby
Enum.new( :Color, :red, :green, :blue )
## or
enum :Color, :red, :green, :blue
## or
enum :Color, [:red, :green, :blue]
```
